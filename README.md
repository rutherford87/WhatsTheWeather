This is a weather dashboard I created called "What's the Weather?". It was created using a Tailwind CDN and Moment.

The API is called to the OpenWeather source URL.

How to use this tool:
Search by city in the search box and click submit.
Each city the user searches for is saved in a list and can be recalled by clicking on the city name. 

Good luck, have fun!

Expansion work:
* Create a for loop for Day[i], where i goes from day 1 through 5
* Continue to explore styling from Tailwind
